Automated Testing System for Evershop
Overview
This project is an advanced automated testing system for the Evershop website, built using Core Java, Selenium WebDriver, Page Object Model (POM), TestNG, Maven, and Apache POI. The system is designed to simplify testing procedures, enhance testing capabilities, and ensure scalability and maintainability.

Tech Used
Core Java: The foundation of the automation framework, enabling robust and scalable code.
Selenium WebDriver: Automates web browser interactions, providing control over various web elements.
Page Object Model (POM): Organizes and structures test automation code for better readability and maintenance.
TestNG: A testing framework for running tests, generating reports, and managing test configurations.
Maven: Handles project dependencies, build lifecycle, and integration with TestNG.
Apache POI: Enables data-driven testing by reading and writing data from Excel files.
Features
1. Page Object Model (POM)
Implemented the Page Object Model (POM) to structure and organize the test automation code, making it more readable and easier to maintain.
2. Web Automation
Utilized Selenium WebDriver techniques to automate various webpage functions, ensuring tests run smoothly and reliably across different browsers.
3. Advanced Interaction Handling
Integrated the Actions class to handle complex user interactions such as drag-and-drop, mouse hover, and more.
Automated dropdown menus, pop-up handling, and other interactive elements to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
4. Complex Task Management
Managed tasks like capturing screenshots on test failures, handling iframes for nested content, and working with web tables to validate data, improving overall testing accuracy.
5. Scalability and Maintenance
Established robust mechanisms for scalability and maintenance, including a data-driven approach using Apache POI to read from Excel files, making it easy to configure and upgrade the testing framework.
